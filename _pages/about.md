I am Tanmay Singh, currently a first year PhD student in the [School of Earth and Space exploration](https://sese.asu.edu/) at [Arizona State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_University), advised by [Prof. Sanchayeeta Borthakur](http://borthakur.asu.edu/index.html). My research interests lie broadly in galaxy formation and processes that impact their evolution. You can read more about my research projects here. 

Prior to coming to ASU, I completed my B.Tech in Engineering Physics from the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT),Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Delhi), in July 2023. I also worked as a visiting student at the [Raman Research Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_Research_Institute) in Bangalore from May to July 2022. I was born and brought up in Lucknow, India. You can find more about me [here](/pages/detailabout).

<!-- My research was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Sanchayeeta Borthakur](http://borthakur.asu.edu/index.html) and [Dr. Siddharth Srivastava](http://siddharthsrivastava.net/).  -->
