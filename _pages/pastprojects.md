<h1>Past Projects</h1>

<p>Throughout my academic journey which was primarly in my undergrad, I focused on exploring physics related research fields.,Here is an overview of some of the key projects I have worked on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Preliminary site quality analysis for an Indian sub-millimeter telescope, focusing on evaluating prospective sites in the Ladakh region using global PWV and other datasets from NASA and ECMWF, and employing tools such as pandas, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, and QGIS.</li>
  <li>Magnetic field topology and properties of solar coronal lines, where I cleaned and aligned images from the Total Solar Eclipse (2017) and retrieved magnetic field lines using methods like RHT and ACF to verify magnetic field topology with MHD equations.</li>
  <li>Post-processing and applications in quantum secure communication, involving the development of optimized software for post-processing in Quantum Key Distribution using entanglement, implementing various reconciliation and privacy amplification algorithms, and conducting experimental verification using lab data.</li>
  <li>Identifying acoustic wave sources on the Sun, studying the physics of acoustic waves on the solar surface, analyzing their properties using simulated data from the MURAM code, and applying image processing techniques like azimuthal averaging with tools such as OpenCV, NumPy, and matplotlib.</li>
  <li>Angular dependence of Fano profile in ultra-cold atomic collisions, studying Fano profiles in cold atomic collisions like H-Kr and analyzing the dependence of Fano parameters with scattering angles, utilizing Python and Code Ocean for programming and calculations.</li>
</ul>
