<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
<p>Outside of my academic life, I have a diverse range of interests that keep me engaged and inspired. One of my favorite pastimes is playing chess. I would be happy to connect if you also play on chess.com; my username is <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/voyager97">Voyager972</a>. Reading books is another passion of mine, particularly pop-science and non-fiction.</p>

<p>I have a keen interest in geopolitics and geography. Music (and singing) plays a significant role in my life as well; I particularly enjoy listening ghazals, Sufi music, and old Hindi songs.</p>

<p>I am also interested in astrophotography and aspire to capture the beauty of the night sky. Although I haven't had the chance to pursue it efficiently yet, it remains a goal I look forward to achieving in the future.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my page. Feel free to reach out if you share similar interests or just want to connect!</p>
