<h1>Overview of my ongoing projects</h1>

<h2>Investigating the IGM and CGM</h2>
<p>The intergalactic medium (IGM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM) play crucial roles in the formation and evolution of galaxies. One of my primary research goals is to understand how Mg II absorbers observed in the spectra of background quasars are connected to galaxies. By analyzing an ensemble of mock quasar absorption spectra generated from cosmological simulations such as <a href="https://www.tng-project.org/">IllustrisTNG</a> and <a href="http://simba.roe.ac.uk/">SIMBA</a>, I aim to determine whether these absorbers originate from outflowing material expelled by star-forming galaxies or from large rotating disks accreting material onto galaxies. This research not only addresses the nature of Mg II absorbers but also examines their impact on galaxy evolution and assesses the accuracy of gas modeling in current simulations.</p>

<h2>Differentiating AGN and SNe Spectra</h2>
<p>Distinguishing between the spectral signatures of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and Supernovae (SNe) is essential for accurately characterizing transient astrophysical events. My research utilizes <a href="https://bayesianlogic.github.io/">Bayesian logic (BLOG)</a> to develop automated methods for spectral classification. By leveraging the probabilistic framework of Bayesian logic, I aim to enhance the precision, efficiency, and versatility of differentiating AGN and SNe spectra.</p>
